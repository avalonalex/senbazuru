# Using senbazuru

Building it, running it, and every option the three commands take. For what the
commands are *for*, start at the [README](../README.md); for the format they
read, [fold-primer.md](fold-primer.md).

## Building

Requires [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/). The project pins Stackage
`lts-22.44` (GHC 9.6.7).

```bash
stack build
stack test
make check      # formatting, lint and tests: everything CI should run
```

`stack.yaml` sets `system-ghc: true`, so Stack reuses a GHC 9.6.7 already on
your `PATH` rather than downloading its own. If you would rather Stack managed
the compiler, delete that line.

## Running it

```
senbazuru render FILE.fold [-o OUT.svg] [OPTIONS]
senbazuru check  FILE.fold [--frame N] [--tolerance DEG]
senbazuru info   FILE.fold [--fold] [--layer-budget N]
```

Working from source, reach the executable in any of three ways:

```bash
stack run -- render FILE.fold              # everything after -- goes to senbazuru
stack exec -- senbazuru render FILE.fold   # after a stack build
make install                               # puts senbazuru on your PATH
```

The bare `--` matters. Without it, Stack reads `--view` and the rest as options
of its own and complains about them.

## `render`

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-o, --output FILE` | Write to a file instead of stdout |
| `--frame N` | Which frame to render (default `0`, the key frame) |
| `--width`, `--height` | Page size in points (default `400`) |
| `--margin` | Blank border in points (default `16`) |
| `--view NAME` | Viewing angle: `top`, `bottom`, `iso`, `front`, `side`. Defaults to `top` for crease patterns and flat-folded models, `iso` for anything with relief |
| `--rotate DEG` | Turn the drawing anticlockwise on the page (default `0`). A folded model lands whichever way up its crease pattern was drawn, and nothing in the file says which way up it should be read — the traditional crane comes out upside down, so its picture in the README is drawn with `--rotate 180` |
| `--transparent` | Omit the white background rectangle |
| `--hide-flat` | Do not draw flat (`F`) or unassigned (`U`) creases |
| `--no-fill` | Draw every crease and fill nothing: a wireframe. Also the way to render a file whose layers cannot be stacked, since nothing then needs to know which is on top |
| `--fold` | Fold the crease pattern along its fold angles and draw the result |
| `--arrows` | Draw the fold that takes this frame to the next one |
| `--steps` | Lay every frame out as one numbered page of figures, at one scale |
| `--columns N` | Figures across the page, with `--steps` (default `3`) |
| `--stacking N[,N...]` | Which layer order to draw, when a model has several: one index per component that has a choice, in the order `info --fold` lists them (default: the first of each) |
| `--layer-budget N` | How many guesses the layer solver may make in one component before giving up (default `1000`) |
| `--offset PT` | Draw a folded model's layers this far apart on the page, so a stack that lands on one spot reads as a stack (default `0`, off). Below about `3` the layers' outlines overlap; see below |

Some combinations are refused rather than quietly resolved, because they
describe different pictures: `--steps` with `--frame`, with `--fold`, or with
`--stacking`, and `--fold` with `--arrows`.

`--offset` is the one flag that needs the layers rather than merely using them,
so four things are worth knowing about it.

**How big to make it.** Below the line weight it is worse than useless: the edge
of the paper is drawn 1.6pt wide, so at `--offset 1.5` consecutive layers'
outlines land on each other and the stack reads as a band of hatching rather
than as sheets. Three points is about the floor and six reads clearly. Above
that, the step times the number of layers has to fit the page — see the next
point — so a deep model may have no comfortable setting at all.
[tour.md](tour.md#how-big-a-step) works the range out.

**It never changes the size of the drawing.** The page is fitted to the paper,
and opening a stack does not shrink the model to make room, so a large step on a
model that already fills the page runs off it. The answers are a wider
`--margin`, a bigger `--width`, or a smaller step.

**It does nothing under `--no-fill`**, which is the escape hatch that asks no
questions about layers at all.

**It refuses a model whose layers run in a circle** — a twist — because stepping
them apart needs one order for the whole model and there is none. The ordinary
picture of one still draws fine.

## `check`

Takes `--frame` as well, and one option of its own.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--tolerance DEG` | How far Kawasaki's alternating sum may sit from zero and still pass (default `0.000573`, which is 1e-5 radians). Raise it for files whose coordinates are heavily rounded |

It exits non-zero when it finds a violation, so it drops into a build or a hook
without anyone grepping the output.

## `info`

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--fold` | Report the layers of each frame folded along its own angles, as `render --fold` draws it. A crease pattern has no layers until it is folded, so this is the only way to see what `--stacking` can choose between |
| `--layer-budget N` | As for `render` |

The `layers` line is where to look when a folded form comes out as a wireframe:
it reports the `faceOrders` the file carries, or, for a folded form without any,
whether one could be worked out and if not why. Where a model has more than one
valid layer order, a `stacking` line follows it with the indices `--stacking`
will accept.

```console
$ senbazuru info examples/crane.fold --fold
...
    layers:   (none in the file; 892 overlapping pairs in 2 components, 5 valid orders)
    stacking: 1 component with a choice; --stacking takes 0-4
```

The two counts differ by one on purpose. The first counts components the way
[Flat-Folder](https://github.com/origamimagiro/flat-folder) does, with the pairs
that were settled outright among them, so that its published figures can be
compared with these. The second counts what you can actually choose. See
[notes/several-stackings.md](notes/several-stackings.md).
